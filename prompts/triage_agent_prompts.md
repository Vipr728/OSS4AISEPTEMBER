# Triage Agent Prompt Engineering Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
The Triage Agent serves as the **intelligent router** that analyzes incoming comments and decides whether they need deep bias investigation or can go directly to summarization.

## ðŸ”€ Routing Logic

### **Route to Bias Agent** when:
- Suspicious promotional language detected
- Brand mentions without disclosure
- Unusual engagement patterns (high engagement, low followers)
- Aggressive attacks on creators/products
- Competitor mentions
- Account created recently with high activity
- Bio contains multiple brand partnerships
- Language patterns suggest astroturfing

### **Route to Summarizer** when:
- Neutral, balanced language
- Authentic user concerns/questions
- Normal engagement ratios
- Established accounts with consistent activity
- No commercial indicators
- Genuine positive/negative feedback

## ðŸ¤– Core Triage Prompt

```
You are a social media content triage specialist. Your job is to quickly analyze comments and route them for appropriate processing.

Analyze this comment and determine if it needs BIAS INVESTIGATION or can go to STANDARD PROCESSING.

COMMENT DATA:
- Text: {comment_text}
- Author: {author_username}
- Bio: {author_bio}
- Followers: {author_followers}
- Engagement: {likes} likes, {replies} replies, {retweets} shares
- Account Verified: {verified_status}

BIAS INVESTIGATION TRIGGERS:
1. Commercial language: "code", "discount", "sponsored", "partner", "ambassador"
2. Multiple brand mentions in bio
3. Aggressive attacks: "fraud", "scam", "lies", excessive caps
4. Competitor promotion: mentions other brands/products
5. Anomalous engagement: high engagement + low followers OR new account + high activity
6. Undisclosed partnerships: promotional language without #ad/#sponsored

RETURN JSON:
{
  "route": "bias_investigation" or "standard_processing",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "triggers": ["list", "of", "detected", "triggers"],
  "risk_signals": {
    "commercial_intent": 0.0-1.0,
    "attack_pattern": 0.0-1.0,
    "engagement_anomaly": 0.0-1.0,
    "profile_suspicion": 0.0-1.0
  },
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of routing decision"
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Scoring Thresholds

### **Route to Bias Agent if ANY:**
- `commercial_intent` > 0.6
- `attack_pattern` > 0.5
- `engagement_anomaly` > 0.7
- `profile_suspicion` > 0.6
- Multiple triggers detected (â‰¥2)

### **Route to Summarizer if:**
- All scores < thresholds
- Single low-risk trigger
- Verified account with normal patterns

## ðŸŽ¨ Prompt Variations by Comment Type

### **Promotional Content Detection**
```
Focus on commercial intent. Look for:
- Discount codes or promotional language
- Brand partnerships mentioned in bio
- Excessive enthusiasm ("AMAZING", "LIFE-CHANGING")
- Call-to-action language ("check out", "link in bio")
- Affiliate disclaimers missing when expected
```

### **Attack Pattern Detection**
```
Focus on aggressive behavior. Look for:
- Character attacks on creator ("fraud", "liar", "scammer")
- Excessive negative emotion (ALL CAPS, multiple exclamation marks)
- Broad generalizations ("everyone who buys this")
- Coordinated language patterns
- Recently created accounts with strong opinions
```

### **Engagement Anomaly Detection**
```
Focus on suspicious metrics. Look for:
- High engagement (>50 likes) with low followers (<1000)
- New accounts (bio mentions 2024) with strong opinions
- Verified accounts with unusual engagement patterns
- Multiple brand mentions in bio but low follower count
```

## ðŸ”§ Fallback Logic

If Gemini API fails, use keyword-based routing:

```python
def fallback_triage(comment):
    bias_keywords = [
        "sponsored", "code", "discount", "amazing", "life-changing",
        "fraud", "scam", "liar", "trash", "idiots", "competitor_brand"
    ]
    
    commercial_score = count_keywords(comment.text + comment.bio, commercial_keywords) / len(commercial_keywords)
    attack_score = count_keywords(comment.text, attack_keywords) / len(attack_keywords)
    
    engagement_ratio = comment.metrics["likes"] / max(comment.author_followers, 1)
    anomaly_score = min(1.0, engagement_ratio * 10)  # Normalize
    
    if commercial_score > 0.3 or attack_score > 0.2 or anomaly_score > 0.5:
        return "bias_investigation"
    return "standard_processing"
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Optimization

### **Fast Pre-filtering**
Before full Gemini analysis, check:
1. Bio contains > 2 brand mentions â†’ Auto-route to bias
2. Text contains discount codes â†’ Auto-route to bias
3. Engagement ratio > 10x follower ratio â†’ Auto-route to bias
4. Account age < 30 days + strong sentiment â†’ Auto-route to bias

### **Batch Processing**
For multiple comments, process in batches of 5-10 with:
```
Analyze these {n} comments for triage routing. For each comment, determine if it needs bias investigation based on the criteria above.

Return array of {n} routing decisions in JSON format.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Outcomes

### **High-Quality Routing**
- 90%+ of promotional content caught for bias analysis
- 85%+ of authentic engagement routed to standard processing
- Minimal false positives (authentic users flagged as suspicious)
- Clear reasoning for each routing decision

### **Efficiency Gains**
- Reduce bias analysis workload by 60-70%
- Focus deep investigation on high-risk comments
- Maintain accuracy while improving speed
- Scale to handle larger comment volumes

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Improvement

### **Monitoring Metrics**
- Route accuracy (manual spot-checks)
- False positive rate (genuine users flagged)
- False negative rate (biased content missed)
- Processing time per comment

### **Prompt Iteration**
- Test new trigger keywords based on emerging patterns
- Adjust scoring thresholds based on performance data
- Add new bias categories as they're discovered
- Refine reasoning explanations for better debugging
